I'm currently working on projects as proof of experience in data analytics and data science. In my repositories, you should be seeing projects related to these topics.

The projects should be furnished gradually with detailed documentations and explanations. Be noted, some projects are direct copies of work during my Master's or pursue of coding camps. Some might use private/non-disclosurable data and will omit this part from the repositories. I will try to include if I am sure the data can be shared.
